# Dotfiles

My configuration files for bash, vim, tmux, etc.

The setup script and these dotfiles currently support the Ubuntu environment only.

## Setup

Just execute the setup script under the folder. The script will install the required packages(packages that I used most), link the dotfiles to home directory by using stow and configure the .bashrc automatically.

```bash
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
